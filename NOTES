Create functional methods for:

server.listen((clientSocket) => {...}) // callback called when a new client connects
server.



Server creates a thread:
  On this thread, the blocking function accept() is called
  When this returns, it calls a callback passing the Socket instance

  The socket then creates another thread:
    This thread loops infinitely...
    When there is input, it reads each line and calls a callback
